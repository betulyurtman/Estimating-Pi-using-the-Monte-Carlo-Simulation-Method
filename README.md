# Estimating-Pi-using-the-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Method
In this project, I wrote an algorithm to estimate Pi number using Monte Carlo simulation. I used different random number generator distributions in NumPy, did performance comparison of NumPy arrays, created plots of the results and prepared a report on Latex.
