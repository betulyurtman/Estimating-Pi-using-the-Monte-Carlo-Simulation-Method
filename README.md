# Estimating-Pi-using-the-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Method
In this project, I wrote an algorithm to estimate Pi number using Monte Carlo simulation. I used different random number generator distributions in NumPy, did performance comparison of NumPy arrays, created plots of the results and prepared a report on Latex.

I prepared this project for my lecture of this semester, Scientific Computing.

The assignment was:
1. Generate 1,000,000 random numbers and apply the Monte Carlo method for calculating Pi by
using the following distributions
a. Uniform
b. Normal (Gaussian)
c. Poisson
d. Power
2. Compare and discuss the Pi estimates by using those 4 distributions. Which one gives the
best estimate of Pi? Explain why.
3. Draw the histogram (# bins=100) plots of the values generated by using 4 distributions.
4. Measure and compare the timings of one of the distributions implemented with NumPy arrays
against a version that uses the Python Lists. You can use timeit function for this.

You can also view my report from my repository, that I have prepared using Latex.

Thank you for reading this! :)
